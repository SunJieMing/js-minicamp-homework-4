# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions ---   A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and can be executed later or can be returned from the initial function to be executed later.

	* Closure  --- Closure in Javascript is when we create a function nested within another function and the interior function has access to variables declared in the outer function, but not to variables in the global scope.  

	* `arguments`  ---  The arguments object is an array-like object built in to Javascript that allows us to access a variable amount of arguments to a function.  

	* Recursion   ---  Recursion is a programming technique that reduces the amount of work necessary to calculate some values by having a function call itself.

	* `prototype`  --- The prototype in Javascript is an object that other objects in the same chain inherit their properties from.  

	* Constructors   --- A constructor is a function that builds the template of an object.  For example, you can create a function called "Car" that defines how many wheels and doors each car should have.  This means that each time we create a new car, (with something like var mazda = new Car;) it will automatically inherit the number of wheels and doors we specified in the constructor function via the Car's prototype chain.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
