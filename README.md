# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

	* Callback Functions = A function passed into another function as a argument, which can then be invoked inside the outer function to complete some type of action.
	* Closure = Closures are what enable us to access data in the scope of functions.
	* `arguments` = These are used in the parantheses when functions are being called which are the result of the keywords from the parameters that were initially passed to our function.
	* Recursion = A technique for iterating over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a desired result.
	* `prototype` = A JavaScript prototype property allows us to add new properties to object constructors. It also allows us to add new methods objects constructors.
	* Constructors = Special method for creating and initializing an object that makes it easy to create multiple objects with the same properties and methods without having to keep repeating ourselves.

	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
