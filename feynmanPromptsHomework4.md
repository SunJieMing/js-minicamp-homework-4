# Feynman Writing Prompts

Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.

##My Definitions: 
---


1.  `Callback Functions`:  Passing in functions as arguments to other functions.
2.  `Closure`:  If you return a function from a function, the function that gets returned remembers the scope of the function that it was returned from.
3.  `arguments`: The arguments object can be used to manipulate the arguments within a function in a special way.  Speficific to what was coved in Lesson 4, the arguments object can be used to multiply all the arguments of a given function together (assuming they are numbers of course).
4.  `Recursion`: Is when you call a function within itself.  This is useful for specific types of looping.  In Lesson 4 and Homework 4 we saw two examples when recursion is helpful in dealing with the Fibonacci Sequence and calculating Factorials.
5.  `prototype`: A type of short cut used inside `Constructors`.  I do not fully grasp this concept, but essentially the .prototype. allows you to save memory, by not including the same function in each object, BUT by having just one function that can be accessed by all the objects.  It would thus seem that this would be very useful if the function you were using was very complex -- to shorten the time JS needed to calculate.
6.  `Constructors`:  `Constructors` allow you to create a system essentially for storing large numbers of profiles, each with properties (ex. username, password, email etc.) which may involve
//encryption and functions etc.
